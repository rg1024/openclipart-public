Clipart Archaelogists
=====================

Archaelogists are people who search the web for resources, looking to find the 
lost artifacts and gold. In our case, we are looking for public domain images 
that we can put into Openclipart and/or convert to Openclipart.

What follows are some lists of sources to mine. We should try to be somewhat
systematic about mining the clipart.

For mining the past for usable clipart:

* http://openclipart.org/for/archaelogists

For making new clipart, see: 

* http://openclipart.org/for/artists

Sources
=======

* We have a dig list file that has all the locations
  to urls with possible clipart images. This file is meant to be 
  a database for now of places that have public domain clipart
  and then who has operated on the files and processed the url.

Format
------

This is the CSV format.

* url,summary,image count,tags,access timestamp, completion timestamp,archaelogist name



Tool Ideas
==========

* One idea is to make some form of chrome extension, or javascript droplet
  or some form of ajax'y webpage script so you can enter in a url
  and then the images or other files you regex for on the page then 
  are pulled onto a separate pane. On that separate pane is the image,
  then title, description fields and then you can submit at the bottom
  of the page and also set per media which ones you will send with 
  the current Openclipart email api to send multiple files.
